## Who Am I

My name is Alan, and I am a Computer Science undergrad at UC Davis. I am
currently getting to know how to use GitHub in order to help myself understand
what tools are available to showcase my abilities and share projects that
I have to offer. As a result, I may not be extremely active due to having
started this endeavor recently (mid July 2020).

## This Page

I would like to make a GitHub page for myself for a few reasons. First,
I wanted to explore what I am capable of doing through learning a bit of web
development. Secondly, it would give me a medium through which I can showcase
whatever programs I have developed (although they may just remain in their
respective repositories for additional assistance). Lastly, I may occasionally
use it as a way of expressing thoughts and ideas I may have from time to time.
(The blog section wouldn't be the main feature of the site, but learning how to
asthetically encode it would be nice to know.)

## Until Then

Please feel free to explore the wonderful code others have to offer on GitHub,
and don't forget to check back to see if this page has been fully developed or
near completion. Hopefully with more time and experience, I should have more
repositories available for you to learn from, use, and improve for everyone.

*Full Disclosure*: I only really know how to speak English and Spanish. I am
still trying to learn Japanese (alongside programming languages, of course). I
still like the quote though (roughly translates to "Go beyond, plus ultra").
